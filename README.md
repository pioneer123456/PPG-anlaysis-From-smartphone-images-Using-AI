# PPG-anlaysis-From-smartphone-images-Using-AI
PPG analysis is carried out from smartphone camera images and an ML model was developed to detect heartbeat per minute.
# PPG_analysis basics:
This file contains basics code to calculate bpm using PPG - analysis library Python (heartpy) -which takes inputs input values that contains mean values of R channnel of various frames of a video.
# creating_database_for_PPG_and _building_AI MODEL:
This file contains code to create a database of 16 video file each of 30 seconds and creating a Deep Learning and Machine Learning model to predict values
# Note: 
The Model was about 74% accurate that could be due during my analysis
The code may contains bugs.
The code is not meant for any industrial application.
